# 🚫 Negative Prompt Wordlist for Generative AI Models

This documentation provides a **comprehensive, categorized, and enhanced list** of negative prompt terms—also referred to as "undesirable keywords"—used to fine-tune the output of **text-to-image AI models** such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL·E, Leonardo AI, and others. These terms are essential for controlling the generative output and preventing visual or contextual errors, inappropriate elements, or stylistic deviations.

> 📌 **Purpose**: Enhance creative control, improve visual fidelity, and prevent unwanted content in AI-generated images.
