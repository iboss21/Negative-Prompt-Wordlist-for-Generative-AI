## ü§ù Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

### **Getting Started**
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 5-10 negative prompts from the most relevant categories
2. **Test Iteratively**: Add more terms based on unwanted elements in your outputs
3. **Category Focus**: Target specific issues (e.g., use "Facial Imperfections" for portraits)
4. **Model Adaptation**: Different AI models may respond differently to the same terms

### **Professional Applications**
- **Commercial Photography**: Focus on technical quality and professional standards
- **Brand Content**: Emphasize appropriate, safe-for-work imagery
- **Marketing Materials**: Use demographic and cultural sensitivity filters
- **Product Visualization**: Prioritize accuracy and clean presentation

### **Advanced Techniques**
- **Weighted Negatives**: Use parentheses and brackets for emphasis: `(bad hands:1.3)`
- **Conditional Logic**: Combine with positive prompts for better control
- **Model-Specific**: Adjust terminology based on your AI model's training data
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build your negative prompt library over time

---

## üìä Quick Reference Cards

### **Portrait Photography**
```
bad anatomy, bad hands, bad face, blurry face, distorted face, extra limbs, 
poor lighting, overexposed, underexposed, low quality, artificial skin
```

### **Product Photography**
```
cluttered background, distracting background, poor lighting, shadows, 
reflections, low quality, blurry, text, watermark, logo
```

### **Landscape/Architecture**

vulgar, mature content, adult content
```

---

## üîß Model-Specific Optimizations

### **Stable Diffusion Models**
- Works best with 75-token limit consideration
- Use commas to separate terms effectively
- Combine with positive prompts for best results

### **Midjourney**
- Use `--no` parameter with these terms
- Effective with shorter, focused lists
- Combine multiple negatives with commas

### **DALL-E & Similar**
- Include in main prompt with "avoid" or "without"
- Focus on descriptive rather than technical terms
- Use natural language integration

---

## üéØ Common Use Cases & Examples

### **Professional Headshots**
```
bad hands, blurry face, extra limbs, poor lighting, casual clothing, 
busy background, distracting elements, unprofessional, low quality
```

### **E-commerce Product Images**
```
people, hands, text, watermark, busy background, poor lighting, 
shadows, reflections, packaging, price tags, barcodes
```

### **Architectural Visualization**

## üìà Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to expand and improve this wordlist! Here's how you can help:

### **Adding New Terms**
1. **Categorize Properly**: Place terms in the most appropriate section
2. **Provide Context**: Explain when and why the term is useful
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify effectiveness across different models
4. **Document Results**: Share before/after examples when possible

### **Improving Categories**
1. **Suggest New Categories**: Identify gaps in current organization
2. **Reorganize Terms**: Propose better categorization for existing terms
3. **Add Subcategories**: Break down large categories for easier navigation
4. **Cross-Reference**: Note terms that apply to multiple categories

### **Quality Assurance**
1. **Remove Duplicates**: Help identify and consolidate repeated terms
2. **Update Effectiveness**: Report terms that no longer work with newer models
3. **Add Model Notes**: Specify which terms work best with which AI models
4. **Verify Descriptions**: Ensure category descriptions are accurate and helpful
